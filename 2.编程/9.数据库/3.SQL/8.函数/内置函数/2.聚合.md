# 聚合函数

## 概述

+ 不能和展开列一起查询

  ```sql
  -- 不正确使用
  SELECT AVG(salary) AS `avg`, id
  FROM employee;

  -- 正确
  SELECT AVG(salary) AS `avg`
  FROM employee;
  ```

+ 可以多个聚合列一起查询

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(id) as '员工数量',
  AVG(salary) AS '平均薪资',
  SUM(salary) AS '总薪资',
  MIN(salary) AS '最低薪资',
  MAX(salary) AS '最高薪资'
  FROM employee;
  ```

## AVG(col)

+ 返回指定列的平均数

  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(salary) AS `avg`
  FROM employee;
  ```

## COUNT(col)

+ 返回只当列中非 NULL 值的个数

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(id) as '员工数量'
  FROM employee;
  ```

+ 使用场景: 可通过 `COUNT(id)` 查询当前表数据的个数

## MIN(col)

+ 返回指定列的最小值

  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(salary) AS '最低薪资'
  FROM employee;
  ```

## MAX(col)

+ 返回指定列的最大值

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(id) as '员工数量',
  MAX(salary) AS '最高薪资'
  FROM employee;
  ```

## SUM(col)

+ 返回指定列的所有值之和

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(id) as '员工数量',
  SUM(salary) AS '总薪资'
  FROM employee;
  ```
