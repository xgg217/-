# order by

## 基本语法

+ `order by ...`
+ 作用:排序

## ASC

+ `ASC` 升序
+ 默认值

  ```sql
  SELECT * from `employee`
  WHERE `name` LIKE '张%' AND (ismale = 0 AND salary >= 12000
  or
  birthday >= '1996-1-1')
  ORDER BY `salary` ASC;
  ```

  ```sql
  -- 使用默认值
  SELECT * from `employee`
  WHERE `name` LIKE '张%' AND (ismale = 0 AND salary >= 12000
  or
  birthday >= '1996-1-1')
  ORDER BY `salary`;
  ```

## DESC

+ `DESC` 降序

  ```sql
  SELECT * from `employee`
  WHERE `name` LIKE '张%' AND (ismale = 0 AND salary >= 12000
  or
  birthday >= '1996-1-1')
  ORDER BY `salary` DESC;
  ```

## 多条件排序

+ `ORDER BY 字段1 ASC, 字段2 ASC` 或 `ORDER BY 字段1 ASC, 字段2 DESC`

  ```sql
  SELECT *,
  CASE
    WHEN `ismale` = 1 THEN
      '男'
    ELSE
      '女'
  END sex
  FROM employee
  ORDER BY `sex` ASC, `salary` DESC;
  ```
