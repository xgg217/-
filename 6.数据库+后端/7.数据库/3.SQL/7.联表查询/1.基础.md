# 联表查询

## 基础

+ 笛卡尔积
+ 左连接：左外连接 left join
+ 右连接：右外连接 right join
+ 内连接：inner join

## 笛卡尔积

+ 示例

  ```sql
  SELECT `t1`.name as '主场', `t2`.name as '客场' 
  FROM `team` as t1, `team` as t2
  WHERE t1.name != t2.name;
  ```

## 左连接

+ `left join` 左边的表连接右边的表，如果满足条件就连接，如果不满足就为空

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM `department` AS d LEFT JOIN `employee` AS e
  ON d.id = e.deptId;
  ```

## 右连接

+ `right join`

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM `employee` AS e RIGHT JOIN `department` AS d
  ON d.id = e.deptId;
  ```

## 内连接

+ `inner join` 条件必须满足，如果不满足就不会出现

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM `employee` AS e INNER JOIN `department` AS d 
  ON d.id = e.deptId;
  ```
